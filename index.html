    <h1>Network Graph Visualization</h1>
    <p>This tool allows you to visualize relationships between words in a network graph format, providing insights into data patterns. Click the Button below to download data that can be used for this website. This website works when using data from https://constellate.org/ when the full text is requested </p>

        </textarea>
        <p>Modify the list of common words to exclude from analysis. These words are typically non-informative.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <label for="targetWord">Target Word:</label>
        <input type="text" id="targetWord" value="crisis">
        <p>Enter the main word you want to analyze. The graph will highlight relationships with this word.</p>

        <label for="contextWindowSize">Context Window Size:</label>
        <input type="range" id="contextWindowSize" min="1" max="20" step="1" value="5">
        <span id="contextWindowSizeValue">5</span>
        <p>The Context Window Size defines the range of words surrounding each occurrence of the target word that are analyzed for potential relationships. This setting allows you to specify how many words before and after the target word should be included in the analysis, (this includes the context window of neighbours).</p>

        <label for="topWordsCount">Top Words count Related to Target Word:</label>
        <input type="number" id="topWordsCount" value="50" min="1">
        <p>Specify how many top related words to display. This helps to focus on the most relevant connections.</p>

        <label for="targetProximityStrength">Target Word Proximity Strength:</label>
        <input type="range" id="targetProximityStrength" min="0" max="10" step="0.1" value="0">
        <span id="targetProximityStrengthValue">0</span>
        <p>Adjust how strongly connected words are positioned near the target word. Increasing this value brings frequently connected words closer to the target.</p>

        <label for="neighborsCount">Neighbors Count:</label>
        <input type="number" id="neighborsCount" value="0" min="1">
        <p>The Neighbors Count enhances the visualization by highlighting the most frequently co-occurring words as direct connections to each of the top frequent words in the graph. If the neighbors count is set to 3, the graph connects and adds the three most frequently co-occurring words that are next to each top word, providing clear insights into direct connections. This feature allows users to explore the strongest relationships within the dataset.</p>

        <label for="neighborWeight">Neighbor Weight:</label>
        <input type="range" id="neighborWeight" min="-1" max="1" step="0.1" value="0">
        <span id="neighborWeightValue">0</span>
        <p>Adjust the influence of neighboring words. A higher weight places more connected neighbours closer to eachother.</p>
